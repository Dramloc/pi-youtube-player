# pi-youtube-player

This is a work in progress.

The goal is to stream youtube audio to a Raspberry PI and play it over the 3.5 jack port.

The backend uses youtube-dl to retrieve audio as a webm and stream it to client.

For now, this uses VLC as a client to play the audio on the Raspberry.

A nice web interface would be nice to search videos and control audio play.
